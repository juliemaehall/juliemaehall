- 👋 Hi, I’m Julie Hall (@juliemaehall), a postdoctoral reseacher at Ghent University. I currently investigate the (overlapping) contribution of 
         dopamine & noradrenaline on reward, memory and salience processing. We also aim to entangle the involvement of these systems in the configuration of 
         network topology using fMRI. 
- 👀 I’m interested in cognitive neuroscience, (the modulation of) neural systems, Parkinson's disease, kitesurfing & other fun things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... always! Contact me if interested 
- 📫 How to reach me julie.hall[@]ugent.be or @juliemaehall
